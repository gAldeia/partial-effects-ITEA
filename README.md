Measuring Feature Importance of Symbolic Regression Models Using Partial Effects
=====

Recently, we studied how the symbolic regression algorithm named _Interaction-Transformation Evolutionary Algorithm_ (ITEA) could benefit from using the Partial Effects to find variable importances and compared the performance with SHAP, LIME, and ELI5.

This repository contains all experiment scripts, data sets, ITEA implementation, and results used for the paper _Measuring Feature Importance of Symbolic Regression Models Using Partial Effects_, submitted for the 2021 GECCO.

> **Paper abstract:
In explainable AI, one aspect of a prediction’s explanation is to
measure each predictor’s importance to the decision process. The
importance can measure how much variation a predictor promotes
locally or how much the predictor contributes to the deviation from
a reference point (Shapley value). If we have the ground truth analytical
model, we can calculate the former using the Partial Effect,
calculated as the predictor’s partial derivative. Also, we can estimate
the latter by calculating the average partial effect multiplied by the
difference between the predictor and the reference value. Symbolic
Regression is a gray-box model for regression problems that returns
an analytical model approximating the input data. Although
it is often associated with interpretability, few works explore this
property. This paper will investigate the use of Partial Effect with
the analytical models generated by the Interaction-Transformation
Evolutionary Algorithm symbolic regressor (ITEA). We show that
the regression models returned by ITEA coupled with Partial Effect
provide the closest explanations to the ground-truth and a close
approximation to Shapley values. These results open up new
opportunities to explain symbolic regression models compared to the
approximations provided by model-agnostic approaches.**
